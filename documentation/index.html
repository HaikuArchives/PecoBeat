<h2>Introduction</h2>
PecoBeat is a pattern based drum sequencer. That means: You can easily create drum sequences and compose a whole drum song!

<h2>What is it worth?</h2>
<p>
I've decided to give away the first release of PecoBeat for free (&quot;free like free beer&quot;).
This is somehow mad since I've invested <u>a lot of work and time</u> into it.
<br>
<br>
But I give you opportunity to show me your favour! :-)
<br>
<br>
I want your feedback! Only if I get your feedback I know, if you like the
program or which features you miss! Please send me an <a href="mailto:freytag@gmx.de">e-mail</a>!
<br>
<br>
And please: vote for it at <a href="http://www.bebits.com">BeBits</a>!
